# Birthday Calculator

## This calcultor builded with python 3.10

The script.py is a python script that get one argument: 
1. Text-file - file with names and birthdays seperated by comma

The script create "Exel file" - file that will contain the results of the script, including those columns: Name, Birthday, Age, Days(until next birthday)

* The order of the Exel-file will be according to the names order in the Text-file. At the end of the script I added code block that allow you to sort the output of Exel-file by the column you want.

**Usage: Python3 script.py <Text-file>**
